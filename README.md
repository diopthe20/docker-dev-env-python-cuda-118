# Project Name: Python CUDA 11.8 Dev Environment Dockerfile

## Overview

This project provides a Dockerfile for creating a development environment with Python and CUDA 11.8 support. It aims to simplify the setup process for developers working on projects that require GPU acceleration.

## Requirements

- Docker installed on your system

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-cuda-11.8-dev-environment.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd python-cuda-11.8-dev-environment
   ```

3. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t python-cuda-11.8-dev .
   ```

4. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run -it python-cuda-11.8-dev
   ```
